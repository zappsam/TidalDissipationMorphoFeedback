# TidalDissipationMorphoFeedback

This code is a version of the MarshMorpho2D model set up to reproduce the simulations performed in the manuscript "Tidal dissipation morphodynamic feedback triggers loss of microtidal marshes" by Samuel M. Zapp & Giulio Mariotti (2024). The script "Coast2D_astrometeo_reduceDTbasic_constanttideTeq.m" is the driver script for the model, and it will run the simulation presented in Figure 2 of the manuscript.
